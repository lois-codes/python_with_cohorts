# This program has two functions: main and heart_rate_calculator.  Please do the following:
# (a)   In the main function, ask the user to  enter age and resting heart rate.
# (i)   In the main function, call the heart_rate_calculator function.  Pass the age and resting heart rate as arguments.
# (c)   In the heart_rate_calculator function, write code to calculate  target heart rate during fitness training with the following formula:
# Target hart rate = (220 - age - resting  heart rate) * 0.4 + resting heart rate
#           Display target heart rate.
# The following is an example.
# Enter  age: 40
# Enter  resting heart rate: 70
# Your target  heart rate is 114.0
